## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18.17.0 or later
- pnpm package manager (`npm install -g pnpm`)
- Supabase account (free tier works fine)
- VAPI account for voice agent features
- Google AI API key (for Gemini Pro)

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/henrykobutra/izzy-02.git

# Navigate to the project directory
cd izzy

# Install dependencies (required before first run)
pnpm install
```

### Supabase Setup

1. Create a new Supabase project at [supabase.com](https://supabase.com)
2. After your project is created, go to Project Settings > API to find your project URL and anon key
3. Review the database schema in the `/supabase/migrations` directory and modify as needed
4. You can implement the migrations manually in your Supabase project or use the Supabase CLI

The database schema is defined in SQL migrations and can be customized to fit your requirements. The types for the database tables can be found in `/types/supabase.ts`.

### AI Services Setup

#### Google AI Studio

1. Visit [Google AI Studio](https://ai.google.dev/) to create an account
2. Generate an API key for Gemini Pro
3. It's recommended to test your agents in Google AI Studio before implementing them in the application

#### VAPI

1. Create an account at [VAPI](https://vapi.ai/)
2. Generate a web token for your project
3. You'll get 1,000 free minutes which is plenty for testing interview scenarios

### Environment Setup

Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory with these required variables:

```
# Supabase - Get these from your Supabase project settings
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_project_url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key

# Google AI - Get this from Google AI Studio
GOOGLE_GENERATIVE_AI_API_KEY=your_google_ai_api_key

# VAPI - Get this from your VAPI dashboard
NEXT_PUBLIC_VAPI_WEB_TOKEN=your_vapi_web_token
```

### Development Workflow

```bash
# Make sure dependencies are installed
pnpm install

# Start the development server
pnpm dev

# Run linting
pnpm lint

# Type checking
pnpm exec tsc --noEmit
```

Visit `http://localhost:3000` to view the application.

### Production Build

- Conversation parameters
- System instructions
- Timeout settings
- Model selection

Example configuration from the project:

```typescript
const config: CreateAssistantDTO = {
  transcriber: {
    provider: "deepgram",
    model: "nova-2",
    language: "en-US",
  },
  model: {
    provider: "openai",
    model: "gpt-4o",
    messages: messagesConstruct,
  },
  voice: {
